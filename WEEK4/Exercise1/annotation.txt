The @SpringBootApplication annotation is a key annotation in Spring Boot that marks the main class of a Spring Boot application. It is a combination of three annotations: @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan. This means it tells Spring that the class is a source of bean definitions (@Configuration), enables auto-configuration so Spring Boot can automatically configure the application based on the dependencies in the classpath (@EnableAutoConfiguration), and it also scans the package and its sub-packages for Spring components like controllers, services, and repositories (@ComponentScan). By using this single annotation, we can quickly bootstrap and launch a Spring Boot application with minimal configuration.
