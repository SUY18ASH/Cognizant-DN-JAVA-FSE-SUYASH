When I accessed the REST endpoint using a browser, I opened the Developer Tools (F12) and navigated to the "Network" tab. After hitting the /hello URL, I clicked on the request entry to view the HTTP response headers under the "Headers" section. It showed details such as Content-Type: text/plain, the status code: 200 OK, and other metadata like Date, Content-Length, and Server. Similarly, in Postman, after sending a GET request to "http://localhost:8083/hello", I clicked on the "Headers" tab in the response section. It displayed the same HTTP response headers, confirming the content type as plain text and that the request was successfully served with a 200 status code. This helped verify that the Spring Boot application is returning the correct response along with appropriate HTTP headers.
