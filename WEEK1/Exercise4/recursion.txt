I view recursion as a strategy for breaking a complex task into smaller, similar subtasks by having a function invoke itself. At its core are two parts: the base case, which stops further calls and returns a direct result, and the recursive case, which handles one piece of the problem before deferring the rest back to the same function. This approach often mirrors mathematical definitions:take factorial, for example, where n! = n × (n–1)!, so the code reads almost as naturally as the formula. Recursion shines when applied to divide-and-conquer scenarios like tree traversal or nested directory searches: instead of juggling loops or stacks manually, each call implicitly holds its own state, local variables, and return point, making the logic both concise and directly aligned with the problem’s structure.

That said, recursion isn’t always optimal out of the box. Deep call stacks can lead to overflow if the recursion depth grows unchecked, and naïve implementations:-such as the basic Fibonacci function, can waste time recomputing the same subproblems, causing exponential blow-up. In those cases, techniques like memoization (caching intermediate results) or refactoring into an iterative, bottom-up dynamic programming approach retain clarity while eliminating redundant work and avoiding excessive stack use. When I ensure a clear base case, watch the recursion depth, and apply memoization where needed, recursion delivers clean, readable solutions that map directly to how I think about the problem.
